# Welcome to Virtual Capricon

Thank you for joining us for the virtual portion of Capricon 42! We're happy to have you here!

This website is only half of the virtual convention. To experience the entire thing, you need to [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/N9NZsCXKpt). If you have not used Discord before, you will have best results if you visit [discord.com](https://discord.com/download) and set up an account BEFORE attempting to join the Server. We also recommend downloading the app rather than using the website version. Note that you must have logged into Discord and accepted the Code of Conduct in order to participate in panel chat via the website.

### How to Use this Website

* Visit the [Schedule](/schedule) tab to find out what's on.
* Items are scheduled in rooms, just like at an in-person convention.
* Go to the room tab to attend the panel. If you have questions for the panelists, you can enter them into the chat window. Those chats also appear on the Discord.  If you'd like to continue the conversation after the panel, visit the Discord "hallway" channel associated with that room.
* Items taking place in [Zoom Room 3](/zoom-room-three) and [Gaming](/gaming) happen directly in Zoom meetings. You will find direct links to those meetings on those pages.
* Don't forget to visit the artists and dealers you'll find in the [Art Show](/art-show) and [Dealers Room](dealers-room)!

### Other Useful Information

* The [Virtual Capricon FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oBzw6dBxYuVC3bSnJcI3j-09k1EUgxTsghdBc9hviV4/edit?usp=sharing) will be updated throughout the convention with your frequently asked questions
* Check out our [Discord Guide for Attendees](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whzM_TaA3LO4XLWDhV0oqrnyEa38GAXvaLsecep1yR8/edit?usp=sharing) for more on how to use Discord and the Capricon 42 Discord server
* Need help? The best way to do that will be to ask at the #help-and-info-desk channel in the Discord. But if you can't do that, you can email infodesk@capricon.org and someone will get back to you.
* Need to report a Code of Conduct violation? Visit #help-and-info-desk in Discord, or email operations@capricon.org

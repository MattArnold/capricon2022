# Schedule

Capricon runs on US Central Standard Time (**CST:** UTC−06:00)

Please see <a href="https://guide.capricon.org/" target="_blank">our full schedule of virtual and in-person events at ConClár</a>. To ensure you have the latest data, make sure you do a hard refresh (Ctrl-F5 for most browsers on a PC). To see ONLY virtual-accessible items, filter based on the Virtual tag.

Prefer a grid? View that [here](https://zambia.capricon.org/ReportPublicGrid.php). Hover over the panel titles for a description and panelists. 

Last year we had a text-based version of the schedule here, but between the weather and Covid, the schedule is just too changeable for us to try to keep it accurate. But our [online guide](https://guide.capricon.org/) will be updated with every change we make!

If you planned your schedule earlier and want to see what's changed, you can view the [change log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wq3D92HwCrdQaEfZsCBtk8XkxncZnBspCVsI21AXdms/edit). That covers changes up to Wednesday, Feb 2. For changes after that, rely on the mobile guide.

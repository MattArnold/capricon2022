# Schedule

Capricon runs on US Central Standard Time (**CST:** UTCâˆ’06:00)

Please see <a href="https://guide.capricon.org/" target="_blank">our schedule of events at KonOpas</a>. To ensure you have the latest data, make sure you do a hard refresh (Ctrl-F5 for most browsers on a PC).

Prefer a grid? View that [here](https://zambia.capricon.org/ReportPublicGrid.php). Hover over the panel titles for a description and panelists.

For those of you in non-Chicago timezones, KonOpas is a little tricky. Look at the top of the guide page for a link to show all "items that ended before \[current time\]." Or check out the not-pretty-but-functional full text schedule below!
